//Difference between initState() and setState():

initState():
It is used for initializing state variables and performing setup tasks that need to be done only once.
For instance, if you want to initialize the background of a page as a certain color suppose white, we use initState or to initialize the count in a counter as 0.

setState():
It is used for calling whenever the state of the widget is to be updated
So like the color of the page will change to something random everytime the user clicks on the button or the count increases as the user gives a prompt.
